# GROMACS 2018.2 with Sliced Pull feature, developed by Molecular Biomechanics (MBM) group at HITS

## Warning: development code

See branch `developments` of this repository for more information on the organization of the repository and how to provide feature suggestions and bug reports.

## Sliced Pull

The Sliced Pull feature extends the pulling code to enable the slicing of the pull groups. Application of an external force to a subset of water molecules enables the simulation of a uniform flow, which can be used to simulate the stretching of a protein under such a flow (see **[documentation](https://hits-mbm.github.io/gromacs-documentation/sliced-pull/2018.2/user-guide/mdp-options.html#com-pulling)** for the information on how to enable and configure the slicing of the pull groups).

### Other versions

This version of Sliced Pull code is developed on top of [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/) [version 2018.2](http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2018.2/release-notes/). See branch `sliced-pull-release-2016` for the version of the Sliced Pull based on GROMACS [version 2016.5](http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2016.5/ReleaseNotes/).
